<h1>Benjamin Daniel Yorke</h1>
<p>I've got more middle names, but I don't use them very often.</p>

<h2>My Craft</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I'm a passionate coder. I code in Ruby and Javascript, using Rails and Node.js respectively.</li> <!-- repetition -->
  <li>I'm a meticulous designer.  I care about the UI just as much as I care about the design of the code itself.</li>
  <li>I'm a voracious learner.  I especially love to study topics that I'll never completely understand.  The challenge excites me.
</ul>

<h2>Technology</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I code in Ruby, Javascript, Rails, HTML, and SASS. I love to work in Node.js, Scala, and Obj-C. I use vim.</li> 
  <li>I like tests.  I've used rspec, cucumber, capybara, jasmine, and mocha. My favorite is still Node's assert module.</li>
  <li>I have extensive experience with GitHub, Heroku, CarrierWave, AWS, OAuth, additional_buzzwords.sample(2).join(', ').</li>
</ul>
