<h1>Benjamin Daniel Yorke</h1>
<p>I've got some pretty strong opinions about code.</p>

<h2>My Craft</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I bleed JavaScript, and I'm particularly excited about React and Node.</li>
  <li>I love working on the front end, and think that building great, powerful UIs pose some of the most exciting engineering challenges.</li>
  <li>I genuinely think mobile should come first in all decisions about the web, and have always worked in a mobile-first responsive fashion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technology</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I really dig JavaScript, React, and Node - it makes a really powerful stack.  I have expirience with Angular and Backbone as well.</li>
  <li>I love my tooling.  I've used and implemented Webpack, Babel, PostCSS, npm Scripts, Gulp, Grunt, and many others to great success.</li>
  <li>I have to put my code somewhere.  I've worked with docker, npmE, git (GitHub and Gerrit), Digital Ocean, AWS, Heroku, PostgresQL, MySQL, and MongoDB.</li>
</ul>
