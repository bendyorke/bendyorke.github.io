<body>
My name is Ben Yorke.  I am a graduate of Dev Bootcamp.

I love the water.

I come from California. More accurately, I come from a place with lots of beaches.  The beach is an integral part of my life, and something I could not live without.  Rain or shine, ocean or lake, I love the beach.  It's where I think and relax the best.

I love Languages.

I've always had a strange obsession with languages.  To me they're more than just a set of grammar rules and vocab lits, but instead a strong reflection of each countries culture, riddled with history, and full of surprises.  

I love learning.

As in really, really love learning.  Whether they're new bar tricks or new languages, I love a good challenge.  That's what brought me to coding - the constant knowledge that you will never really know it all.  There will always be something you don't understand.
