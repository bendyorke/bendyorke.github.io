<h1>My name is Ben Yorke.</h1>

<p>I am a graduate of Dev Bootcamp.</p>

<h2>I love the water.</h2>

<p>I come from California. More accurately, I come from a place with lots of beaches.  The beach is an integral part of my life, and something I could not live without.  Rain or shine, ocean or lake, I love the beach.  It's where I think and relax the best.</p>

<h2>I love Languages.</h2>

<p>I've always had a strange obsession with languages.  To me they're more than just a set of grammar rules and vocab lists, but instead a strong reflection of each country's culture, riddled with history, and full of surprises.</p>

<h2>I love learning.</h2>

<p>As in really, really love learning.  Whether they're new bar tricks or new languages, I love a good challenge.  That's what brought me to coding - the constant knowledge that you will never really know it all.  There will always be something you don't understand.</p>
