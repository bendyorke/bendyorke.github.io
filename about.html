<h1>My name is Ben Yorke.</h1>

<p>My favorite animal is the Sea Turtle. My favorite color is orange. If I could go anywhere in the world, it would be Iceland.</p>

<h2>I have a dog</h2>

<p>So my instagram followers can get a bit annoyed at times.  His name is Ender, after Andrew Wiggin.  I like to go hiking, running, to the beach, and to the snow, which is pretty convenient for him.</p>

<h2>I can speak french</h2>

<p>"I've always had a strange obsession with languages.  To me they're more than just a set of grammar rules and vocab lists, but instead a strong reflection of each country's culture, riddled with history, and full of surprises.".to_french</p>

<h2>I like learning for the sake of learning</h2>

<p>As in I really, really love learning.  Whether they're new bar tricks or new languages, I love a good challenge.  That's what brought me to coding - there is always more to learn</p>

<h2>I like simple things</h2>

<p>I like things simple.  Simple code, simple design, simple solutions.  I like to be minimalistic wherever I can.  I also enjoy fresh ingredients, real food, and baking my own bread.</p>

<p>Here's a quote to show what a deep thinker I am.</p>

<blockquote>The sum of human wisdom is not contained in any one language, and no single language is capable of expressing all forms and degrees of human comprehension.</blockquote>
